INSTALLATION
============

These are the instructions for installation of Risiko in development mode (for changing the software) and production mode (for deploying on a server).

 #. Install safe-geonode::

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:geonode/unstable
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install geonode
        source /var/lib/geonode/bin/activate
        pip install safe-geonode

 #. Modify your INSTALLED_APPS to include safe_geonode::

        INSTALLED_APPS += ('safe_geonode', 'leaflet',)

 #. Add an entry for geonode_safe in your urls.py::

        urlpatters += ((r'^safe/', include('safe_geonode.urls'),)

 #. Copy the missing static files, create the new tables in the database and reload the apache web server::

        sudo geonode collectstatic
        sudo geonode syncdb
        sudo service apache2 reload

 #. If you need sample data, get it from the inasafe_data repository::

        git clone https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe_data.git

 #. And load it using ``safeimportlayers``::

        geonode safeimportlayers inasafe_data/hazard
        geonode safeimportlayers inasafe_data/exposure

 #. Finally, navigate to the safe interface to try it out:

        http://localhost/safe


===========
LIMITATIONS
===========

safe-geonode is a very new project.
However, we work on the philosophy that stakeholders should have access to the development and source code from the very beginning and invite comments, suggestions and contributions.


As such, safe-geonode currently has some major limitations, including

 * All data must be provided in WGS84 geographic coordinates
 * Neither AIFDR nor GFDRR take any responsibility for the correctness of outputs from safe-geonode or decisions derived as a consequence
